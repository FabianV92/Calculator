# Calculator
My first calculator in JS/ working so far, need to change the design and reformat the script

- Calculator able to calculate point before line/ only arithmetic calculations supported
- Type the calculation via keyboard in the input field or use the mouse 
- Pressing "Enter" will calculate and gives the result
